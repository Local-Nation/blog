My father-in-law visited me in his final days. He was a great ceramist who worked his entire life building this art form. I have always had an appreciation for art but he is the one who introduced me to the world of pottery. He would bring me a souvenir of art from his every foreign trip and we would discuss Indian ceramics and artisans with great enthusiasm. He never explicitly asked me to take it up as a career but his last visit seemed like his way of expressing his desire for me to take on his legacy forward and help people explore this beautiful art form. That’s when I left my job and started Amalfiee to celebrate his legacy.

As a woman, after having worked for more than 7 years in HR, starting something completely different which required turning my entire house into a warehouse was not what I’d expected. While starting off, I faced obstacles everywhere; right from opening a bank account to figuring out the packaging and shipping. I struggled to keep our amazon account active since I couldn’t understand the e-commerce setup. 

But throughout the journey, I have had immense faith and support from my husband, who has never let me doubt my capabilities. Together, we even managed to drive Amazon to have a team dedicated to helping women entrepreneurs. Once when there was an exhibition at Taj Lands End, we got the spot at the 11th hour and were sold out within 3 hours making a remarkable profit!

In a very short duration, we’ve managed to achieve record sales across 15 different platforms! As of today, we have reached over 10,000+ customers, owing significantly to our newly launched website. Thanks to our dedicated and brainy team who handle everything from photography to strategy, to develop our brand value. Now we’ve also started getting orders from companies like HDFC, JW Marriott, and even invitations to collaborate with brands like Chumbak!
