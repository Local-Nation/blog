I am Sagar Bansal, originally an Electronics and Telecommunications Engineer in Delhi, with 6 years of corporate experience as a financial & strategy consultant, and an international trade specialist. The idea for Hipsters came to me when I was in the job. In 2017, after my father passed away, I took a job sabbatical to help my family to cope with the loss and get my house in order. I then went for a solo backpacking trip to Europe, and visited many countries to find the meaning of my life and explore different cultures. As luck would have it, my exploration led to the discovery of good-quality, innovative products in their markets that were completely out of reach for Indians.

On my return, I envisaged “Hipsters,” a company to provide superior quality innovative products in India and deliver them at an affordable price. Not satisfied by the substandard designs of products in India, I launched a brand that could introduce product design innovation in the country with high quality, multi-utility products that could add value to user lives. Making things productive is the motto of our high-value offerings along with affordability.I created my first prototypes, starting with the traveler’s notebook series – a blend of journal, a wallet and an organizer. I used my savings to create several high-quality functional prototypes that can be manufactured at low costs.

I left my job six months back to focus on the brand and create value. And my business has become quite profitable, due to constant positive feedback, retention of loyal customers, and appreciation of quality from all quarters.In these three years, the company has developed 10 variations of different products and generated a turnover of Rs. 35 lakhs.
