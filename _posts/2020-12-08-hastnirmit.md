I was always fascinated with bookmarks. Bookmarks enhance the whole reading experience and lures you into reading more! Hastnirmit is based on this very thought. As a kid I used to participate in several extracurricular activities like art, craft, dancing etc, and I was equally bright academically. Though I’m an architect by profession, I couldn’t let go of my admiration for bookmarks.

I enjoyed looking at various aesthetic Bookstagram pictures of readers and loved the fact that bookmarks were used as a prop to enhance the picture. I began painting a lot of bookmarks inspired from various designs on Pinterest - it was very therapeutic and relaxing! When I decided to start my own page, ‘Hastnirmit’ was the first word that popped in my mind.
Hastnirmit, means hand-made or hand-crafted and it perfectly describes the products, as not only the artwork is hand-painted but also the final product is hand-crafted locally.

My ideas for bookmarks are mostly drawn from real life pictures, experiences and most importantly memories. All this makes them more personal and unique for every reader. When someone tells me that their idea of a perfect day is: reading on the sofa, enjoying the weather through the window, with a pet cat and cup of coffee, I create a bookmark for just that feeling.
 
Initially what started as a Bookmarks Shop now has several other products such as mugs, phone-cases, coasters, and tote bags! Although finding good vendors and resources was a difficult task and involved a lot of trial and error, I always knew that I had the potential to do more. I believe that when unique ideas and required skills are coupled with undying spirit and determination, we can definitely achieve anything that we desire.
