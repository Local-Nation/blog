People in the village would judge our women artisans and throw comments like ‘How can you leave your children to go to Bangalore to learn to stitch? You are a mother!’. So what if they are mothers, they have dreams too! The fact that our women now make more money than their husbands and are financially independent is a huge game-changer.

Every morning, wearing a handbag, looking smart, holding a file, and going to work is a big attitude shift for all the women in the village such that now many want to join I Am Rural. Pushpa, one of our staff, used to roll bidis for a living to educate her adopted daughter. So many things about this whole sentence are empowering. For her, IAR is not a brand or job, it’s an emotion.

Pushpa once asked me ‘Can I take two hours off on Thursday, I want to learn English.’ Now all three, Pushpa, Vasanta, and Rekha go to English classes. At the age of 35-40, when people don’t dream and hope of being successful, these women stand out.

During the lockdown, we took a massive hit. We couldn’t sustain. When we spoke to all the three women about it, they said, ‘It’s okay even if you don’t pay us, we are all in this together’ and in August, we started from 0 balance yet again! From convincing these women to join us and learn by offering money, to a point where they care less about the money and just want to be a part of it ‘cause it’s their company now, we have come a long way. Eventually, this brand would be entirely run by rural women and we’re heading in the right direction!
