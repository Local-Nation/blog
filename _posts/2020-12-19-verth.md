Shreya and I are friends since university days. At a point in our lives, both of us started switching to sustainable living by considerably reducing the plastic usage. Early in the journey, we realised that sustainability comes at the expense of burning a hole in our wallets. That is when we decided to give up our corporate jobs to take up this cause.

We started ‘Verth Box’, India's first eco-friendly and zero plastic subscription box to help people switch to sustainable lifestyle at affordable cost. It is a subscription box curated with five-six handpicked eco-conscious products from sustainable brands and homegrown artisans.
