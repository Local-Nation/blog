The first time I came across cloth pads was on my trip to New Zealand. When I came back to Auroville, I just started making a few batches of them for the localities. They soon became very popular despite it’s raw design.

10 years ago, when I was working closely with NGOs having low funds, I met my co-founder Jessamijn. That’s when we started Ecofemme as a social enterprise to provide livelihood to the women and funds for the functioning of the NGOs. It’s been a steady ride since then, but selling has been more difficult in India than other countries due to the social stigma around menstruation and the relatively newer introduction of disposable pads in India as compared to the west. 

Women from rural parts would initially ask ‘How do we dry them in the open?’ and women from urban areas would question, ‘Isn’t going back to cloth pads a backward step?’ Recently when grassroot organizations started talking about environmentally friendly products and toxin-free products for our body, we’ve gained momentum.

Our ‘Pad for Pad’ initiative aims to educate adolescent girls about menstruation and eradicate the stigma around it. When they come for the workshop, they’re particularly shy about it, but by the end they become totally comfortable to talk openly about it and become advocates for the cause by wishing to share it with others. Seeing them make an informed choice really puts a smile on my face
