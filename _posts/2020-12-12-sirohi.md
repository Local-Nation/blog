Back in 2008, when I was finishing my Masters from University of Warwick, I had 3 months to complete my dissertation. That’s when I started thinking about travelling to a country to explore my education from a different perspective.My research on the Success of Microcredit Provision landed me an internship with a small NGO in Peru. Coming from India, I had plenty of reasons to find an equally compelling town back home. But after a lot of apprehensions from my parents and relatives about the finances and my ability to pull it off, I fund-raised my ticket to Peru!

After my time in Peru, I wanted to keep the rush of what I had done alive and affect true change in India as well. Although I started with a job in Investment Baking, I soon quit to form the Skilled Samaritan Foundation, which aims to provide steady income opportunities to women from rural communities.Once when I was chatting with the villagers of U.P, I noticed that the charpoy they were sitting on was made from candy and chocolate wrappers. And I soon realised there was an opportunity there! In 2018 we started working with women from the same communities putting their existing skill-sets of charpoy weaving to use.

Social barriers were our biggest challenge. It was difficult getting women onboard and so we had to start our work with only one woman, Gauhar Fatma. It was challenging to change their traditional perspectives rooted since ages. More and more women joined when they realised that this was a legitimate source of income, and today, we work with over 200 women! These women can now imagine a life for themselves beyond their household & families and envision a brighter future by availing education for their kids. Once, a woman artisan told me “I bought my husband a phone today from my hard-earned money. I never thought such a day would come!”

Making impressive products with plastic waste is a step taken by Sirohi to reach out to global conscious buyers. When people get to know about this fact, most of them remain awe-struck. Through the years, Sirohi & I have grown a lot. It has truly been a wild ride right from the start when I quit my job, to this point in the journey of taking Sirohi & all its people global.
