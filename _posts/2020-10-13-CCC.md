It all began with a cat I met in 2014, during my structural engineering internship in Zurich, Switzerland. I was living with a beautiful Swiss Family who owned 3 cats. This was the first time I had the opportunity to live in close quarters with Cats or even Pets of any kind. Over time, I developed a bond with Schoggi - a black bombay cat whose fur was darker than the darkest Swiss chocolate! I fell in love with Schoggi, and I'd like to think he loved me too. Schoggi showed me that Cats are creatures of divine complexity. They love if you let them, in their own way and only if you respect their individuality.

I returned to India, convinced my family to let me get a cat and there has been no turning back ever since! Today, we have adopted three cats, have owned two other Persians and continue befriending, petting, feeding & taking care of new ones who turn up at our doorstep or out on the alley every day!

I graduated as a civil engineer and started working as a structural consultant; when I got an admit from Columbia University for a masters degree in structural engineering, I took my chances and I opted out of it! I realized I wanted to start my own business sometime down the line and not stick to a 9 to 5 job.

A few years and many cats later, I decided to start @curiouscat_co , a brand that celebrates this deep love for Cats. On that note, I must sign off to attend to Zuzu, my cat who has been eyeing me with a look that conveys his desire to chase a ball.”

Today, Curious Cat Company has a wide range of products with elegant and subtle cat designs! 5% of their Annual Profits are donated to Cat Welfare Projects. From mobile covers to home decor to fashion, they’ve got you all covered!
