Shruti & I first met in school, but we never spoke much. Our paths crossed again studying at a Management School in Singapore. I’ve always hoped to rule the management sector and work in a fast-paced environment, while Shruti wanted a slow life, using her creative juices to think deep in practice. Our life and aims seemed quite sorted for us in our own world and we soon turned to the best of friends.

It was just a regular sunny day in Singapore when Shruti said, “Yaar, coffee pe chalte hai kya?” And little did we know, that that coffee outing would change our lives forever! We noticed a lovely couple across the coffee table with a beautiful box of flowers - tied with a ribbon, blooming with lilies and peonies. I turned to Shruti and said, “That’s so beautiful! I wish that somebody could gift that to me!” The day passed, and so did the year.

On my next birthday, when we were back home in Kolkata, Shruti and my sister went out of the way and tried to recreate that box of flowers, one of the best I’d seen just to see me surprised! While I sat deeply overwhelmed listening to Shruti telling me excitedly about all the madness behind putting that box together, at a random moment, the germ of the idea was born! Soon, my dingy garage became our second home, and we found ourselves creating mood boards, sketching out ideas, and making product lists. My quick thinking and Shruti’s attention to detail came handy. And that’s how Twigs & Tales was born!
