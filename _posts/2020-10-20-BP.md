Sumit is the most supportive husband. I remember the time when he had a working pattern of 14 days on-off; Although I had my 9 to 5 job then, I’d often find myself having a lot of free time. That’s when I turned towards art! It was something that I’d always fancy as a kid when my Dadi used to make household items of clay. I started experimenting and creating my own at home. Sumit often said “Rupa, you must pursue this as a career! Let’s sell it online.” And that’s how I hit the road.

My products were unique, but not many people knew about it. Things took a giant leap when @malikkadua posted a story of the shadow box that she’d bought from me. That day, I got over 500 orders! I couldn’t believe what had just happened! As I had no team, my husband and my sister helped me fulfill the orders, working day and night with our corporate jobs over a period of 2 months! Mallika is one of the best people I’ve ever met and I’m really grateful to her for supporting me ever since.

But today it is a mixed feeling. On one hand, I have thousands of people who wish to have a piece of my art, and on the other hand, I have a baby to look after, and my job. In attempts to make me pursue my dream, Sumit tells me “Quit your 9 to 5 job, that’s not meant for you”. But I’m not ready for it yet. I just wish I could somehow have 48 hours in a day!
