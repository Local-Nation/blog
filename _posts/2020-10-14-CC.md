Just after my graduation, my friends asked me, ”So bro, what are your plans after college?” I replied “I think I want to sell umbrellas”. All I got was awkward glances and cynical chuckles. Who sells umbrellas after 22 years of education? Well, not many. But I was always of the opinion that it’s not good grades but unique ideas that make people successful.

I imagined umbrellas with colourful doodles of Vada Pav, Chai, Baarish, Traffic, and everything that connects us to the rain. So when others searched for jobs to lead a secure life, I was hustled through the city with a minimum capital and a bright idea. I hunted for designers who translated my designs on paper, searched for a manufacturer, and before I knew all of my life savings were invested in a couple of umbrellas! Just when I felt everything was on track, catastrophe struck. 90% of the umbrellas that were produced were defective and there was nothing I could do about it. I felt deeply demotivated, and the thought of quitting did pass my mind. But hey, I hadn’t come this far to give up!

So I decided to give it another shot. I spent days and nights doing grunt work and supervising the whole production. And finally, after a lot of hard work, I managed to make quality umbrellas. But when I went shop to shop to sell them, most of the retailers said “Aye! What have you scribbled on this?”. However, there was always one retailer in each locality who would believe in my idea, and that is when I learnt the most important lesson of my journey: ‘When you try, you don’t fail. The real failure is not trying at all.

Soon, a massive wave of Cheeky Chunk started on social media and newspapers and we became the #1 Bestsellers on Amazon! We sold out the stock within 3 weeks! One day, when I was having a very bad day at office, a random stranger called and told, “All my life I hated the rains and I never went out during the rains because I was too bored and lazy to carry a boring umbrella, but after buying your umbrella I wait for it to rain just so that I can flaunt it!”. I had succeeded in my mission! What others thought of just as a utility, I had turned it into a fashion statement.

Today Cheeky Chunk has a wide variety of designer umbrellas and makes the monsoons brighter for thousands of people every year!
