As a kid, my Nanu would take me to the supermarket, and the things that caught my eyes the most were soaps. My Nanu says, once I forced him to buy me the most expensive soap in the market, not just one but ten of them!

And that’s when my obsession for soaps came in front of the world. Since then, people keep giving me handmade soaps from all around the world, and you know what, I totally love it!

How did I ever think I could do something not related to soaps? I found the reason to follow my passion in the lockdown. My Dad was a little skeptical at the start and he used to say, ‘You did your masters from Hult, and now you are going to make soaps!?’ He had his reasons to be, right? 

But today, my parents are the biggest supporters of the brand to the extent that my parents came up with the brand name FOAMO, FOAM+FOMO. Yes, they're well aware of all the millennial terms! Now, my Dad wouldn’t shower without these soaps of mine and my Mom on the other hand is happy to be able to have me around unlike the past 4 years
