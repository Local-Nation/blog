I started my art journey in 2013 on Facebook as a hobby. But it was only in 2018 when I got in touch with the art community. So when I learnt about the concept of doll making, I knew I had to give it a shot as I’ve been a fan of soft toys since my childhood. And @artytales was born which tells the tale of my art journey!

Doll making is popular only in a few countries. So I had to translate every time while talking to the foreign artists. I had to learn about the right materials and find the local alternatives. And thus a 4-5 month long experimentation and transition phase started. It takes about 7 days to make a doll from scratch; from coloring the fabric to stitching and stuffing to finally giving it a face!

I used to work part time on this as I had a job at IIM Lucknow. But I reached a point where I could only manage 3-4 hours of sleep and I quit my job 2 months ago to be a full time artist for a while. My very 1st order was for an embroidery portrait for a marriage anniversary. Soon she wanted dolls for her and her husband. Soon, she placed an order for her brother’s doll, who was no more. The doll had to be differently abled using a wheelchair. So I had to go an extra mile to source a wheelchair. But it was all worth it when I got a text on rakshabandhan that she’d tied a rakhi to the doll.

Recently, for a marriage proposal, I had to make a doll for a Navy person. Writing ‘Marry Me?’ on the beach and clicking pictures for social media, I love my work. I also did a full family of dolls for a girl who lives in Australia, away from her family. It’s really a milestone to earn people’s trust to create something that is so precious and emotional to them. Their happiness means a lot to me!
