I was always excited about making everything with chocolate. I went to Europe to study food science and got a specialization in confectionery and chocolate technology from England and France. For seven years I stayed in Europe and worked with renowned chefs like Pierre Hermé, Jean-Charles Rochoux, Patrick Roger, etc. After gaining experience of working at famous restaurants, including Hotel Le Meurice and Hotel Plaza Athénée, I came back to India along with my husband, Parthesh.

Both of us started exhibiting desserts at various exhibitions, and in 2014, we set up their boutique café in Kala Ghoda, Mumbai. We pooled in our savings, as well as received some financial help from family, and set up the first store with a capital of Rs 1.5 crore.

Two years ago, I decided to adopt a sustainable approach for my dessert making that encourages responsible and slow consumption. For us, making products in a responsible, ethical manner is a lot more important than just making a product that you can indulge in. One incident that shaped our philosophy is the Kamala Mills fire in 2017. The fire ravaged a commercial complex in Lower Parel on the night of December 29. It resulted in 14 casualties and several injuries. The fire also burned down our store in the complex and resulted in the complete closure of that branch.

It was upsetting at first as the operations closed down within eight months of the store’s opening but what we learned was to take it in the stride and move on, and come up with a new strategy since it was not in our hands. Post that incident, we created a digital retail branch across India. It allowed us to deliver longer-shelf life products across the country. Our journey is not pretty as it looks like. We met with disappointment and rejection to a point where I almost gave up. But today I am so grateful for all the farmers and co-operatives and every person along the way that understood where I came from and agreed to join hands with me.
