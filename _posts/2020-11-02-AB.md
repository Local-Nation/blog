I lost my father to a cardiac arrest in March. It was really sudden, he was on his way to work. My sister and my mother flew in the very next day, but he was in a coma and he suffered for 17 days. He fought very hard, but we lost him.

Due to Covid, we got stuck in Paris for three months. We would rarely leave the house as we were scared, paranoid, and not in a good frame of mind. I remember, one day we ran out of bread and I decided to make one at home as it didn’t make sense to go to the grocery store just for bread, that was really the seed for everything. 

When I came back to India, I didn't want to be alone with my thoughts, so I decided to start baking bread to keep myself occupied. I’d send it to friends and family nearby and soon they started pushing me, “These are really good, you should sell it!” I wasn’t very sold on the idea at first, but my mother and my sister said why don't you do charity with it, and that’s how Arun’s came to life. This bakery isn’t just my mother and my effort, but I’m really thankful for the support we’ve received from my family and friends to the extent that it was my best friend’s idea to name it after my dad, Arun.

My dad had a fighting chance for those 17 days because he was privileged enough to have those services, but there are so many people in India who cannot afford it. We donate all the profit and proceeds for the treatment of those suffering from cardiac issues. Even if I can help one person live a little longer in a healthier and better way, I truly think it would make my life more meaningful.
