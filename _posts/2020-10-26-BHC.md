The funniest fact is that I was never a coffee drinker. It was only during a project on supply chain that I was introduced to the coffee-making process. The deeper I dived, the more I got interested. And those 6 weeks turned into 6 months! I had a gut feeling that this is what I was destined to pursue. Years later, after several courses of coffee making, I finally took the plunge and started Bili Hu Coffees.

Right from my 1st blend for a kitchen order to brewing for the biggest hotel chains in India, itâ€™s been quite a journey. Once I was at a coffee tasting event in Bombay when a man walked towards me and started asking me about my blends; several questions later, he introduced himself as Mr. Vikram Oberoi. While I was still processing the fact that I was talking to the owner of the biggest hotelier in India, he invited me to his office for a coffee tasting with his team! Apart from my brews, they were all interested in knowing more about how coffee is grown, its composition, the right temperature, and a dozen other things. Several conversations and hours of tastings later, I was offered to create special blends for their chain!

Since then, there has been no looking back! Today, we serve at the Taj, the Oberoi, Pullman, and many more. Serving these specialties is an honor but I would always love brewing commercially for every household in India.
