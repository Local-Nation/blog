The classic things people ask me are, “Is it going to take away my bad dreams? How do I know which dreamcatcher is mine?” And I say, well, it’s going to take away all the negativity because it’s an energy filtering system. It’s the dreamcatcher that chooses you instead of you choosing it; when you look at it, you’ll know it!

After quitting my job as a full time set dresser and art director for Bollywood, I found my heart’s calling in making dreamcatchers. The people that I am working with now don’t want fame, power, or even money. All they ever want is love!! It is so beautiful to see their happy faces when I see their work because they put so much heart into it and what they are looking for is just acceptance. Due to Covid, as there’s not much work to allot, I get calls from all our teams asking for work as they feel sad and a little misplaced now. They say “We can make it for free too!” I get teary-eyed.

Aashna, who’s been working for @soulworks has now enrolled her daughter into a good school, the one that she couldn’t afford before. Last Eid, Shaheen, told me that she bought new clothes for Eid after 5 long years! To be honest, if someone asks my mother, 10 years ago when I started this we never thought this would go anywhere. Today, my heart feels so happy to see what an impact @soulworks has had. It’s truly a blessing to work with such kind souls and still be excited to go to work everyday!
