Getting into NIFT, Delhi was always my dream. But making big at life became a bigger dream when I got into NIFT. It was the last year of college, and we were supposed to go for internships and put together a final assignment. While everybody around me searched for internships at big fashion houses to ensure a secured future, I dared to move to a village to create a craft-based collection.

It was a huge decision, my career path was at risk. I joined an NGO based in a little village near Dehradun-Mussorie. I took inspiration from local artisans and interacted with the villagers. Not only did I manage to put together a beautiful collection, but I also won the “Best Design Collection” and “Most Creative Design Collection” awards at NIFT! The high risk had paid high returns.

I got various job offers from top design houses but I continued staying in Dehradun. I collaborated with a Blind Relief Association where I taught hand knitting to several women. Their feeling of independence motivated me to start my own women empowerment initiative where I train women from surrounding villages to improve their knitting and stitching skills, promoting their financial independence and confidence through their craft. Last month a group of women made a bag for me that said “Thank You Didi”, I felt a deep content. After all, their smiles are the most valuable currency for me!

Itihasikala is backed by the Khemka Charitable Trust, Ballabhgarh. The products are made out of ecologically safe materials and they’ve been featured on various prestigious platforms including the Kala Ghoda Arts Festival.
