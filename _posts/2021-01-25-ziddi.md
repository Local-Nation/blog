I've always been fond of handmade products and started making necklaces for myself when I was in the 10th standard. For our weekly outings, mom-dad would take us only to Dilli Haat because that's where Malvika and I would enjoy the most! During my college days, I would pair up jewellery with my otherwise easy-going clothes and often get asked where I got the jewellery from, and that was a different feeling altogether!

After graduation, while I was still doing a 9-5 job in architecture, I knew deep down that my heart belongs elsewhere. Around the same time, Malvika completed her graduation from NIFT. It was then that we knew there couldn't be a better team than the both of us to turn our passion for crafts and handmade products into a full-time job. 

Heavily inspired by our ancestral roots in Rajasthan, Ziddi was born from an obstinacy to express the beauty of imperfection. In a matter of just one year since Ziddi was founded, we can proudly say that we have revived the Patwa craft of Rajasthan which was almost on the verge of disappearing. We have empowered an entire family of Patwa artisans by making work opportunities available to them and giving them a new life when they had lost all hope.

Ziddi is a sincere urge to bring a change in the lives of the craftsmen who are dependent on a fading craft for their subsistence and also to our environment by constantly contributing towards sustainability.
