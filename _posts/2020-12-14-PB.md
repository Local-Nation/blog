Saher and I love to travel. We started off as a traveling flea market more than 15 years ago when the concept of a market was limited to Goa. We have met quite a few interesting artisans on our journey and this has sort of helped us to kickstart our journey. We used to collect interesting artifacts from the places we travelled to and then sell those at the flea markets across many cities in India. We had a great response from the customers back when we were running the flea markets. But one the thing that all of us would ask us ‘How and where to find you throughout the year when we wish to buy things from you’ This constant nagging sort of inspired us to open our first store in Bangalore in 2007

I remember the time when we were looking for renting spaces in Bangalore for our first store. We had an eye on a lovely space and we were very hopeful that we would get it. But after waiting for months, the owner declined the offer. In the middle of a let down we went for a walk towards the castle street where we saw a board ‘Space to rent’. That very moment we approached the owner and surprisingly in the next one hour we had the deal finalized. The whole experience from the letdown to surprisingly finding the space for our first store and then setting it up would be the happiest memory for us. Looking back, it feels it was all meant to be.

Over the years we have slowly scaled down on the flea market as we needed to focus on the store. Earlier we used to outsource most of the things but after since the start of the store, we have started making things of our own. It’s just the two of us on the team. We do not have an elaborate team of artisans who make the products for us but we are the real artisans. All the leather products are personally handcrafted by us and every piece is very close to our hearts. And we believe that’s our USP, to be able to put so much of thoughtful energy and love to every piece that we make. There are times we feel quite overwhelmed.  We have two kids whom we homeschool. I play huge roles both at home as a mom and at store. We have had to let go of quite a few opportunities bcz we were not able to do things on a large scale. But the brand is so personal is to us that we doubt an outsider would be able to grasp the concept and the energy. But what I’m grateful for is that we work as a family and that keeps us going.
