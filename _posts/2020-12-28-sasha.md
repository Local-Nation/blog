The idea of wood-framed sunglasses was on my mind for three years. I was involved in our family business of manufacturing and exporting furniture but was always keen to use wood differently. In 2018, along with the guidance of my father, Darshan Singla, and my wife, Anisha’s expertise in the financial sector, I launched Sasha’s first collection.

We make these sunglasses out of walnut wood and try to make use of them in a way that makes the accessory look unexpected and unique. Wood is not malleable and creating a design that is fashionable, comfortable, and of good quality was the biggest challenge. With no prior knowledge and expertise in the eyewear industry, the biggest challenge was to get the designs right.

We spent a year developing to overcome this problem. We use a  mix of waste wood from their manufacturing business and wood is sourced through environmentally sustainable and legal means from all across the country.  We started out with two craftsmen, today, we are a team of 18 - the three co-founders and 15 artisans, who have over a decade of experience in woodwork.
