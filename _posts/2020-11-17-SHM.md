I graduated from Wharton with a degree in finance but soon realized that the one thing I had studied hard for was also the thing which I didn’t like. And that put me in a bit of a tough spot. I came back to Mumbai and did what I was best at-baking. I started making cookies for friends and family, just to keep myself busy and not in my wildest dream had the thought of turning it into a business.

A friend suggested pursuing baking until I figured out what was next. And that’s how we started selling cookies from the backseat of a Tata Nano. I ran a campaign, 'If you follow the Nano, you get cookies'. The places where the Nano went were selected based on the voting on Twitter and Facebook. ‘Send it to Nepean Sea Road or send it to Lower Parel!’ It was all so exciting! During those days nobody knew who we were. So, we were just this ‘Nano selling Cookies’

We chose to remain anonymous which created a buzz and led to several crazy rumors like ‘A Druggie woman makes the cookies, which is why they’re so addictive! People used to wait in huge numbers for the nano to the extent that we had to ration it to 2 cookies per person. 

Once my staff called me to inform me about the scenario. The police were shooing the Nano away because of the chaos it was causing. Also, some celebrity’s car stopped by to buy cookies in the midst of it all. All the mystery was picked up by newspapers who started calling me the ‘Batman of Baking’. I even did an entire NDTV interview with my back facing the camera! All of it was very Mafia-ish
