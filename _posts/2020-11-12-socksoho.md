It all began in the Soho neighborhood of New York. I saw it filled with driven and passionate people with dapper suits. All of them looked similar to me, except one day, I saw a man in a typical black suit but rather colorful socks! A stark contrast. I wondered if it was a sign of confidence or self-expression, or was he just enjoying being himself? And SockSoho was born in the length of that very question!

To be honest, my family didn’t approve of my decision, and my friends were shocked. They all thought I had gone crazy! Who leaves their dream life in the US? But in my heart, I knew I was doing the right thing. So, I quit my job and returned to India to find something that I’d love to do for the next 10-15 years. 

I started working with Simarpreet Singh, a friend from my under-graduation days, who had founded media-tech company Mindbatteries. The image of the man from Manhattan never left my mind and that’s when I knew I had to give it a try. When the website went live and to our surprise, in less than 48 hours we had more than 1000 orders!
